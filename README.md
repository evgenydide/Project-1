Project 1: Standardized Test Analysis

### Overview

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.

### Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. Since then, levels of participation in multiple states have changed with varying legislative decisions. This project aims to explore trends in SAT and ACT participation for the years 2017-2019 and seeks to identify states with significant changes in their participation rates.

### Techincal Report Contents

The technical report is mostly just a collection of data organized, calculated and presented in ways that the starter code sheet suggested. In the end it presents a clear view of trends for standardized test participation in all states as well as a list of states where participation didn't change much over all 3 years.
